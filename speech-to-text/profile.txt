what is machine learning let's say we have a picture in we need a program to tell us if there is a banana in this picture traditional programming required human 3 final set of instructions recognise this would require tons of gold and leaves plenty of room for error is machine learning which are the methods of data to be precise lucky for us when students units and Smartphones we have a tons of data in machine learning instead of following hardcoded instructions problem can learn from data or adapt its behaviour according to experience we can divide machine learning into free broad categories of supervised learning and unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning in supervised learning we need to provide a data set label samples of training data the program will analyse them and should be able to correctly determining labels for new data this technique is used for example in speech recognition or by YouTube to recommend you video unsupervised learning is used when you have unlabeled data the most common and supervised learning method is cluster analysis able to find hidden similarities patterns or groups running methods are used for example in Bioinformatics for genetic last week of face recognition and last but not least reinforcement learning this technique is life teaching your dog new 3 you provide the program feedback in form of reward and punishment based on which it can determine ideal behaviour or strategy was in a specific context this can be used to teach to program to play poker for control robotic arm thanks for watching if you enjoyed this video please hit the like button and don't forget to subscribe to see more videos like this in future
